Problem description:
A seamstress needs to keep the measurements off all her customers so that she doesn't have to risk losing the measurements by writing them on a book which can easily get missing.

Group of people involved:
Tailors and seamstresses

Solution:
1. The program should ask for the name and sex of the customer,
2. The program then prompts you to enter the various measurements you have,
3. Your entries are then saved for easy access later.
4. A search tab should be included in the program to enable the seamstress find a customer with ease.
5. This program should also be able to give the required body parts whenever a seamstress needs it. E.g if the seamstress needs to sew a blouse, it should ask for the bust size, shoulder, waistline etc.
